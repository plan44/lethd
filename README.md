# p44featured - daemon for hardware features with common API

*[[if you want to support p44featured development, please consider to sponsor plan44]](https://github.com/sponsors/plan44)* 

**p44featured** is just one possible use for the [**p44features**](https://github.com/plan44/p44features) collection of widely different hardware effect, display, output and user input "features" as used in my projects for exhibition and art, gathering them under a common JSON API that allows external orchestration of many such hardware features from a higher level application. We've been using nodejs in recent projects, but anything that can handle a TCP socket level JSON API is fine.

Please refer to the [**p44features**](https://github.com/plan44/p44features) for more information about the growing list of features.

The p44features concept was developed for the [ETH Digital Platform](https://plan44.ch/custom#leth) and subseqeuntly refined for various projects, some still in the making and thus unreleased.

I usually run p44featured on OpenWrt (and macOS during development), but it can be compiled and run on any Linux platform.
